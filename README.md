# Homework-01 Horiseon Webpage

This repository contains HTML, CSS, and image files which are utilized on the live webpage found below.

The site can be reached at this URL: https://ryryp97.github.io/Homework-01/

The purpose of creating this repo was to practice refactoring an existing codebase.  This was achieved through the following actions: consolidating the CSS selectors and properties to eliminate redundancies, utilizing semantic HTML elements, adding proper alt attributes to image elements, and leaving appropriate comments.

Below is a screenshot of the live webpage:

The header elements "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management", and "Social Media Marketing" are links that, when clicked, redirect the user to the appropriate part of the webpage. 

###Credits

I'd like to credit [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and their HTML and CSS guides, which have been a tremendous help.
